                                    <h3><span class="primary">Overview</span></h3>
                                    <p>This was a group project to design both
                                        <li>A MIPS CPU using Verilog that implements 48 Arithmetic, Load-Store and Control Instructions</li>
                                        <li>A testbench, that when given a Verilog design of a MIPS CPU, identifies which instruction was incorrectly implemented</li>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>My role was to design a testbench to test 36 
                                        Arithmetic and Load-Store instructions.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3><span class="primary">Design Decisions</span></h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The testbench is expected to make memory available to the CPU using the Avalon memory protocol,
                                        which will allow the CPU to access instructions from memory as well as
                                        read and write data. The testbench also has access to the value of register v0 used to return
                                        values (based on the MIPS C ABI). Hence the testbench may use both the return value and
                                        memory contents to determine if an instruction was correctly implemented or not.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The general expectation for this coursework is that the tesstbench would be written in Verilog
                                        and would instantiate the top level module of the CPU to run tests. However, this makes
                                        writing individual tests cumbersome and limits how the tests can be written.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Hence, I decided to use the Verilog Procedural Interface (VPI) to allow my Verilog testbench to call
                                        C++ code. This code is then compiled and later linked with the Verilog simulatior compiled by Icarus
                                        Verilog.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3><span class="primary">Implementation</span></h3>
                                    <img src="../img/projects/tb1.png" width="100%"><br><br>
                                    <p> My testbench implements a virtual ram using a C++ hash map. This 
                                        makes all 2<sup>28</sup> word addresses available to the CPU under 
                                        test while minimizing resource usage, which would be 
                                        difficult without VPI. 36 different testcases corresponding to 
                                        each instruction being tested were written in C++. These are linked
                                        one at a time with the rest of the testbench and run to test each instruction.
                                        An oversimplified example of a testcase is shown below
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="../img/projects/tb1-testcase.png" width="100%"><br><br>
                                    <p>
                                        The code shown has an if else macro to either
                                        inject MIPS inline assembly with the desired instruction,
                                        or simply perform the operation with C code.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The code shown is actually run twice: Once on the CPU under
                                        test with the inline assembly instructions, and once on the
                                        host x86 machine running the testbench. Each writes to a separate
                                        RAM which is then compared at the end to determine if the test passes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In reality, each of the 36 arithmetic, load and store test 
                                        cases tests each instruction with at least 10,000 unique 
                                        values. These numbers are either generated on the fly 
                                        using Fibonacci logic, or in the case of immediate 
                                        values, are inserted during compilation. Edge cases are 
                                        considered separately. Every test case makes the CPU 
                                        execute between 30,000 and 164,000 instructions. 
                                        Hence across the testbench, a total of 360,000 inline assembly 
                                        instructions are executed, out of over 3.1 million 
                                        instructions executed in total. 
                                    </p>
