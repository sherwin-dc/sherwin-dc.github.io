                                    <p>This was a group project in a team of three, where we were given three snippets of C code:
                                        <ul>A recursive fibonacci generator function</ul>
                                        <ul>A random number generator (Linear Congruential Generator)</ul>
                                        <ul>A linked-list traversal function</ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>We were tasked to design an ISA and CPU that efficiently perform the same tasks defined in the 3 functions
                                    above. The CPU would be designed and simulated in Intel Quartus Prime to target an Altera FPGA.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3><span class="primary">Design</span></h3>
                                    <p>
                                        In this project I had focused on analyzing the recursive fibonacci function and making our custom CPU
                                        execute it efficiently. Seeing that this function involves a large number of recursive calls to
                                        itself, I took inspiration from the SPARC architecture to design the CPU with a large register file 
                                        and movable register window.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        SPARC CPUs usually have hundreds of registers, with only 32 being made visible to the program through
                                        a register widow. When a function call is made, arguments are placed by the caller on the bottom of the
                                        register window, which then moves down by a certain amount during the function call such that these arguments
                                        appear at the top. This is then replaced with the return value by the callee, before the window moves back up
                                        when the function returns. (See the below video for a demonstration of how this works)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I decided to use a register file with 128 registers, with a window size of 8. This would be accompanies by an
                                        ISA that supports 8 registers, as well as `call` and `rtn` instructions that move the register window up or down
                                        by a specified amount. I believe SPARC could have done better by allowing the programmer to specify how much 
                                        the window should move up/down by, which would allow a compiler to optimize for maximum depth of function calls
                                        before spilling registers to memory, assuming less registers are needed per function.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After synthesizing the CPU for the FPGA, I found that the critical path was included reading values from the
                                        register file, because several layers of muxes were needed to select the correct registers.  This was limiting
                                        the maximum clock speed and hence I decided to add a small (L-1?) cache just for these 8 registers that are updated
                                        whenever a register is written to or when the register window moves. Admittedly this design may not be the most
                                        friendly to synthesize, with the register file looking as follows:
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="../img/projects/register-file.jpg" width="100%">
                                    <br><br>
                                    <p>
                                        Nevertheless the design is efficient in running this snippet of code. I found that it uses less instructions to
                                        calculate a fibonacci number compared to arm CPU (tested on a Raspberry Pi 3). This is also shown in the following 
                                        video where I briefly explain how the movable register window works in our CPU, and give a short 
                                        demonstration of it being used when calling a recursive function.
                                        
                                    </p>
