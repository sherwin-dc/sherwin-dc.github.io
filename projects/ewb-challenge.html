                                    <h3><span class="primary">Overview</span></h3>
                                    <p>This was a team project, with members studying different courses at Imperial, to come up with an 
                                        engineering design to improve the lives of a target community in Peru.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>Our team decided to come up with a way to improve the community's access to information
                                        and raise levels of digital literacy in the area. We narrowed down our implementation to 
                                        installing a local server to act as a database of apps and other information. We eventually
                                        submitted our proposal detailing our design decisions, feasibility study and an overview of
                                        costs involved and timeline needed for installation.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3><span class="primary">Design</span></h3>
                                    <p>
                                        In coming up with a project proposal, we considered several ideas ranging from using smartphones
                                        to form a wireless mesh network to using power lines to transmit broadband data over long distances.                                 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After performing a feasibility study of each idea we eventually decided on installing routers at key
                                        locations to form a mesh network, with a server that would serve information locally. The sever could also
                                        host offline apps that residents would find useful, such as messaging or speech translation. This would be
                                        supported by existing cellular internet to fetch information online.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I considered the use of mesh networks using openWRT, a linux distribution specialized to run on routers. These 
                                        routers would be able to form mesh networks using the IEEE 802.11s protocol, connected to a local server that
                                        would host apps on docker instances.
                                
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        The following video - narrated by all members in our team - gives a brief overview of our project. In this video I also perform a demonstration of one
                                        such app, rocket.chat, that is locally hosted on a server facilitating communication between a user on a 
                                        PC and smartphone accessing the app.

                                    <p>Our proposal was submitted to Engineers Without Borders (EWB) for this competition,
                                        which saw 10,000 students take part. Although our submission did not progress to the
                                        Grand Finals, we were informed our team was amongst the top 450 students in the UK and Ireland
                                        to have their project considered. We also received written feedback from multiple reviewers on
                                        our proposal, a few of which are referenced below.
                                    </p>

                                    <blockquote>A truly stunning submission, with very little room
                                        for error. As highlighted in my specific feedback
                                        points, this group have clearly tailored their
                                        submission to meet the design challenge, and
                                        appeal to the mark scheme. Kudos!

                                    <blockquote>Overall, a very well-rounded project. The team
                                        has certainly ticked most of the boxes, clearly
                                        thinking about the community in all areas. They
                                        have provided a solution with a good life cycle
                                        and adoption process, which I am sure will
                                        improve the lives of those in the community.
                                        It was a pleasure to read!

                                    <blockquote>Overall, the Community Wireless Mesh Network
                                        is a fantastic design concept and the use of
                                        available technologies tailored to the community
                                        needs makes it a simple solution. It is clear that
                                        you understood the social and economic
                                        struggles of the community well and designed
                                        your response accordingly. It would be good to
                                        see some collaboration with the community as
                                        part of the design process and stakeholder
                                        engagement and input is always key to a
                                        successful project and its implementation.</blockquote>
